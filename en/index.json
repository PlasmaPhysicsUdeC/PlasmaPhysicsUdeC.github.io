Large scale magnetic fluctuations are dominated by non-linear MHD wave-wave interactions following a −5/3 or −2 slope power-law spectrum. After the break, at scales in which kinetic effects take place, the magnetic spectrum follows a steeper power-law k −$α$ shape given by a spectral index $α$  5/3. Despite its ubiquitousness, the possible effects of a turbulent background spectrum in the quasilinear relaxation of solar wind temperatures are usually not considered. In this work, a quasilinear kinetic theory is used to study the evolution of the proton temperatures in an initially turbulent collisionless plasma composed by cold electrons and bi-Maxwellian protons, in which electromagnetic waves propagate along a background magnetic field. Four wave spectrum shapes are compared with different levels of wave intensity. We show that a sufficient turbulent magnetic power can drive stable protons to transverse heating, resulting in an increase in the temperature anisotropy and the reduction of the parallel proton beta. Thus, stable proton velocity distribution can evolve in such a way as to develop kinetic instabilities. This may explain why the constituents of the solar wind can be observed far from thermodynamic equilibrium and near the instability thresholds.","tags":["\"Ion-cyclotron waves\"","\"Quasilinear theory\"","\"Space plasma physics\"","\"Temperature anisotropy instability\"","\"Turbulence\""],"title":"Effects of the Background Turbulence on the Relaxation of Ion Temperature Anisotropy  in Space Plasmas","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Roberto E.

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Observed electron velocity distributions in the Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind exhibit a variety of nonthermal features which deviate from thermal equilibrium, for example, in the form of temperature anisotropies, suprathermal tail extensions, and field-aligned beams. The state close to thermal equilibrium and its departure from it provides a source for spontaneous emissions of electromagnetic fluctuations, such as the whistler. Here we present a comparative analysis of the electron whistler-cyclotron and firehose fluctuations based upon anisotropic plasma modeled with Maxwellian and Tsallis-kappa-like particle distributions, to explain the correspondence relationship of the magnetic fluctuations as a function of the electron temperature and thermal anisotropy in the solar wind and magnetosphere plasmas. The analysis presented here considers correlation theory of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and the dispersion relation of transverse fluctuations, with wave vectors parallel to the uniform background magnetic field, in a finite temperature anisotropic thermal bi-Maxwellian and nonthermal Tsallis-kappa-like magnetized electron-proton plasma. Dispersion analysis and stability thresholds are derived for these thermal and nonthermal distributions using plasma and field parameters relevant to the solar wind and magnetosphere environments. Our results indicate that there is an enhancement of the fluctuations level in the case of nonthermal distributions due to the effective higher temperature and the excess of suprathermal particles. These results suggest that a comparison of the electromagnetic fluctuations due to thermal and nonthermal distributions provides a diagnostic signature by which inferences about the nature of the particle velocity distribution function can be ascertained without in situ particle measurements.

In this paper, we study the broadband spontaneous electromagnetic fluctuations in a relativistic and magnetized pair plasma described by Maxwell–Jüttner distribution functions, based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and particle-in-cell simulations. It is shown that the transverse electromagnetic fluctuations are constrained by a temperature-independent critical frequency $ømega _m̊c=sqrt̊Ømega _rc̊^2+(ck)^2$, which separates the collisionless damping regime ($| ømega | łt ømega _rm̊$) from the case where the waves can propagate without damping ($| ømega | gt ømega _rm̊$). Further, relativistic simulations show an excellent agreement between analytical and numerical results. We expect this formalism to contribute to obtaining useful physical information about the state of relativistic plasmas.","tags":["\"methods: analytical\"","\"methods: numerical\"","\"plasmas\"","\"radiation mechanisms: thermal\"","\"relativistic processes\"","\"waves\""],"title":"SPONTANEOUS ELECTROMAGNETIC FLUCTUATIONS in A RELATIVISTIC MAGNETIZED ELECTRON-POSITRON  PLASMA","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Roberto E.

An analytical treatment, based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, consistently shows that spontaneous fluctuations in plasmas with stable distributions significantly contribute to the observed magnetic fluctuations in the solar wind, as seen, for example, in [S.D. Bale et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 211101 (2009)], even far below from the instability thresholds. Furthermore, these results, which do not require any adjustable parameters or wave excitations, are consistent with the results provided by hybrid simulations. It is expected that this analysis contributes to our understanding of the nature of magnetic fluctuations in the solar wind. © 2014 American Physical Society.","tags":[],"title":"Solar Wind Thermally Induced Magnetic Fluctuations","type":"publications"},{"authors":["P.

Here, we present the results of a study which shows the role that higher-order-modes play in limiting the electromagnetic whistler-like fluctuations in a thermal and non-thermal plasma. Our main results show that for a thermal plasma the magnetic fluctuations are confined by regions that are bounded by the least-damped higher order modes. We further show that the zone where the whistler-cyclotron normal modes merges the electromagnetic fluctuations shifts to longer wavelengths as the be increases. This merging zone has been interpreted as the beginning of the region where the whistler-cyclotron waves losses their identity and become heavily damped while merging with the fluctuations. Our results further indicate that in the case of nonthermal plasmas, the higher-order modes do not confine the fluctuations due to the effective higher-temperature effects and the excess of suprathermal plasma particles. The analysis presented here considers the second-order theory of fluctuations and the dispersion relation of weakly transverse fluctuations, with wave vectors parallel to the uniform background magnetic field, in a finite temperature isotropic bi-Maxwellian and Tsallis-kappa-like magnetized electron–proton plasma. Our results indicate that the spontaneously emitted electromagnetic fluctuations are in fact enhanced over these quasi modes suggesting that such modes play an important role in the emission and absorption of electromagnetic fluctuations in thermal or quasi-thermal plasmas.","tags":[],"title":"The role of higher-order modes on the electromagnetic whistler-cyclotron wave fluctuations of thermal and non-thermal plasmas","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Roberto E.
