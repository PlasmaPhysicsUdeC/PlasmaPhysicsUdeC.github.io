abstract: Two fundamental challenging problems of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas
  are the understanding of the relaxation of a collisionless plasmas with nearly isotropic
  velocity distribution functions and the resultant state of nearly equipartition
  energy density with electromagnetic plasma turbulence. Here, we present the results
  of a study which shows the role that higher-order-modes play in limiting the electromagnetic
  whistler-like fluctuations in a thermal and non-thermal plasma. Our main results
  show that for a thermal plasma the magnetic fluctuations are confined by regions
  that are bounded by the least-damped higher order modes. We further show that the
  zone where the whistler-cyclotron normal modes merges the electromagnetic fluctuations
  shifts to longer wavelengths as the be increases. This merging zone has been interpreted
  as the beginning of the region where the whistler-cyclotron waves losses their identity
  and become heavily damped while merging with the fluctuations. Our results further
  indicate that in the case of nonthermal plasmas, the higher-order modes do not confine
  the fluctuations due to the effective higher-temperature effects and the excess
  of suprathermal plasma particles. The analysis presented here considers the second-order
  theory of fluctuations and the dispersion relation of weakly transverse fluctuations,
  with wave vectors parallel to the uniform background magnetic field, in a finite
  temperature isotropic bi-Maxwellian and Tsallis-kappa-like magnetized electron–proton
  plasma. Our results indicate that the spontaneously emitted electromagnetic fluctuations
  are in fact enhanced over these quasi modes suggesting that such modes play an important
  role in the emission and absorption of electromagnetic fluctuations in thermal or
  quasi-thermal plasmas.
