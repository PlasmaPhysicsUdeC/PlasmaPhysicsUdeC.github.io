abstract: A sufficiently large temperature anisotropy can sometimes drive various
  types of electromagnetic plasma micro-instabilities, which can play an important
  role in the dynamics of relativistic pair plasmas in space, astrophysics, and laboratory
  environments. Here, we provide a detailed description of the cyclotron instability
  of parallel propagating electromagnetic waves in relativistic pair plasmas on the
  basis of a relativistic anisotropic distribution function. Using plasma kinetic
  theory and particle-in-cell simulations, we study the influence of the relativistic
  temperature and the temperature anisotropy on the collective and noncollective modes
  of these plasmas. Growth rates and dispersion curves from the linear theory show
  a good agreement with simulations results.
