abstract: Spontaneous fluctuations are a robust phenomenon of plasmas near equilibrium,
  which does not depend on the existence of instabilities, and their characterization
  provides valuable information about the role of the relativistic temperatures $T∼
  mc^2$ in relativistic regimes. In this paper, we study the broadband spontaneous
  electromagnetic fluctuations in a relativistic and magnetized pair plasma described
  by Maxwell–Jüttner distribution functions, based on the fluctuation-dissipation
  theorem and particle-in-cell simulations. It is shown that the transverse electromagnetic
  fluctuations are constrained by a temperature-independent critical frequency $ømega
  _m̊c=sqrt̊Ømega _rc̊^2+(ck)^2$, which separates the collisionless damping regime
  ($| ømega | łt ømega _rm̊$) from the case where the waves can propagate without
  damping ($| ømega | gt ømega _rm̊$). Further, relativistic simulations show an excellent
  agreement between analytical and numerical results. We expect this formalism to
  contribute to obtaining useful physical information about the state of relativistic
  plasmas.
