abstract: Turbulence in space plasmas usually exhibits two regimes separated by a
  spectral break that divides the so called inertial and kinetic ranges. Large scale
  magnetic fluctuations are dominated by non-linear MHD wave-wave interactions following
  a −5/3 or −2 slope power-law spectrum. After the break, at scales in which kinetic
  effects take place, the magnetic spectrum follows a steeper power-law k −$α$ shape
  given by a spectral index $α$ > 5/3. Despite its ubiquitousness, the possible effects
  of a turbulent background spectrum in the quasilinear relaxation of solar wind temperatures
  are usually not considered. In this work, a quasilinear kinetic theory is used to
  study the evolution of the proton temperatures in an initially turbulent collisionless
  plasma composed by cold electrons and bi-Maxwellian protons, in which electromagnetic
  waves propagate along a background magnetic field. Four wave spectrum shapes are
  compared with different levels of wave intensity. We show that a sufficient turbulent
  magnetic power can drive stable protons to transverse heating, resulting in an increase
  in the temperature anisotropy and the reduction of the parallel proton beta. Thus,
  stable proton velocity distribution can evolve in such a way as to develop kinetic
  instabilities. This may explain why the constituents of the solar wind can be observed
  far from thermodynamic equilibrium and near the instability thresholds.
