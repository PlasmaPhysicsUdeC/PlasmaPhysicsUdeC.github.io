abstract: The observations in the solar wind, which are usually organized in a beta-anisotropy
  diagram, seem to be constrained by linear instability thresholds. Unexpectedly,
  under these quasi-stable conditions, there is a finite level of electromagnetic
  fluctuations. A relevant component of these fluctuations can be understood in terms
  of the electromagnetic fields produced by the thermal motion of the charged particles.
  For the simple case of parallel propagating fields in an electron-proton plasma,
  we study the effect of the parameter ??pp/??c that characterizes the different space
  physics environments, and can affect the continuum spectrum produced by these fluctuations,
  which in turn may be used to understand the relevance of these processes occurring
  in a specific plasma environment.
