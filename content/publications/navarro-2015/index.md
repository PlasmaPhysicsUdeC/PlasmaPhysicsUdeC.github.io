abstract: Remote and in situ observations in the solar wind show that ion and electron
  velocity distributions persistently present deviations from thermal equilibrium.
  Ion anisotropies seem to be constrained by instability thresholds which are in agreement
  with linear kinetic theory. For plasma states below these instability thresholds,
  the quasi-stable solar wind plasma sustains a small but detectable level of magnetic
  fluctuation power. These fluctuations may be related to spontaneous electromagnetic
  fluctuations arising from the discreteness and thermal motion of charged particles.
  Here we study magnetic Alfvén-cyclotron fluctuations propagating along a background
  magnetic field in a plasma composed of thermal and suprathermal protons and electrons
  via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The total fluctuating magnetic power is
  estimated in a proton temperature anisotropy-beta diagram for three different families
  of proton distribution functions, which can be compared to a number of recent measurements
  in the solar wind.
