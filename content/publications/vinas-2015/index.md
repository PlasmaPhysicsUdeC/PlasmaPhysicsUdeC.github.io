abstract: ©2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Observed electron
  velocity distributions in the Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind exhibit a
  variety of nonthermal features which deviate from thermal equilibrium, for example,
  in the form of temperature anisotropies, suprathermal tail extensions, and field-aligned
  beams. The state close to thermal equilibrium and its departure from it provides
  a source for spontaneous emissions of electromagnetic fluctuations, such as the
  whistler. Here we present a comparative analysis of the electron whistler-cyclotron
  and firehose fluctuations based upon anisotropic plasma modeled with Maxwellian
  and Tsallis-kappa-like particle distributions, to explain the correspondence relationship
  of the magnetic fluctuations as a function of the electron temperature and thermal
  anisotropy in the solar wind and magnetosphere plasmas. The analysis presented here
  considers correlation theory of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and the dispersion
  relation of transverse fluctuations, with wave vectors parallel to the uniform background
  magnetic field, in a finite temperature anisotropic thermal bi-Maxwellian and nonthermal
  Tsallis-kappa-like magnetized electron-proton plasma. Dispersion analysis and stability
  thresholds are derived for these thermal and nonthermal distributions using plasma
  and field parameters relevant to the solar wind and magnetosphere environments.
  Our results indicate that there is an enhancement of the fluctuations level in the
  case of nonthermal distributions due to the effective higher temperature and the
  excess of suprathermal particles. These results suggest that a comparison of the
  electromagnetic fluctuations due to thermal and nonthermal distributions provides
  a diagnostic signature by which inferences about the nature of the particle velocity
  distribution function can be ascertained without in situ particle measurements.
