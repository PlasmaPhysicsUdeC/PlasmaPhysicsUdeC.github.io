 abstract = {A sufficiently large temperature anisotropy can sometimes drive various
types of electromagnetic plasma micro-instabilities, which can play an
important role in the dynamics of relativistic pair plasmas in space,
astrophysics, and laboratory environments. Here, we provide a detailed
description of the cyclotron instability of parallel propagating
electromagnetic waves in relativistic pair plasmas on the basis of a
relativistic anisotropic distribution function. Using plasma kinetic
theory and particle-in-cell simulations, we study the influence of the
relativistic temperature and the temperature anisotropy on the
collective and noncollective modes of these plasmas. Growth rates and
dispersion curves from the linear theory show a good agreement with
simulations results.},
