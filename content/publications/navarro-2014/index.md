abstract: A kinetic description of Alfvén-cyclotron magnetic fluctuations for anisotropic
  electron-proton quasistable plasmas is studied. An analytical treatment, based on
  the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, consistently shows that spontaneous fluctuations
  in plasmas with stable distributions significantly contribute to the observed magnetic
  fluctuations in the solar wind, as seen, for example, in [S.D. Bale et al., Phys.
  Rev. Lett. 103, 211101 (2009)], even far below from the instability thresholds.
  Furthermore, these results, which do not require any adjustable parameters or wave
  excitations, are consistent with the results provided by hybrid simulations. It
  is expected that this analysis contributes to our understanding of the nature of
  magnetic fluctuations in the solar wind. © 2014 American Physical Society.
