We are a team of physicists that are curious about various phenomena
occurring in space and astrophysical plasmas. Our main interests cover
the understanding of heating and acceleration processes in
collisionless plasmas (e.g. the solar wind); what is the role of
turbulent transport and pressure balance in magnetospheric dynamics;
what is the origin of wave fluctuations and instabilities; and what
processes regulate the shaping of particle distribution functions,
among others. We also work on the development of high performance
plasma computer simulations based on Particle-in-Cell, hybrid, or kinetic
(Vlasov) methods. Our group is located at the Physics department of
the University of Concepción, Chile.
