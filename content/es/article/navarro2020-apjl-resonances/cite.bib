 abstract = {Wave-particle interactions are believed to be one of the
                  most important kinetic processes regulating the
                  heating and acceleration of solar wind plasma. One
                  possible explanation for the observed preferential
                  heating of alpha (He+2) ions relies on a process
                  similar to a second-order Fermi acceleration
                  mechanism. In this model, heavy ions are able to
                  resonate with multiple counter-propagating
                  ion-cyclotron waves, while protons can encounter
                  only single resonances, resulting in the subsequent
                  preferential energization of minor ions. In this
                  work, we address and test this idea by calculating
                  the number of plasma particles that are resonating
                  with ion-cyclotron waves propagating parallel and
                  antiparallel to an ambient magnetic field in a
                  proton/alpha plasma with cold electrons. Resonances
                  are calculated through the proper kinetic
                  multispecies dispersion relation of Alfv√©n waves. We
                  show that 100\% of the alpha population can resonate
                  with counter-propagating waves below a threshold in
                  the differential streaming between protons and He+2
                  ions, where $U_0=-0.532$, $a=1.211$, $\beta_0=0.0275$, and
                  $b=0.348$ for isotropic ions. This threshold seems to
                  match with constraints of the observed $\Delta U_{\alpha p}$ in the
                  solar wind for low values of the plasma beta
                  ($\beta_p$). Finally, it is also shown that this process is
                  limited by the growth of plasma kinetic
                  instabilities, a constraint that could explain
                  alpha-to-proton temperature ratio observations in
                  the solar wind at 1 AU.},
