Native of [Linares (Chile)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linares_(Chile)), I studied an M.Sc. program in Physics at the Physics Department of the University of Concepción, under the guidance of [Dr. Jaime Araneda]({{< relref "/authors/jaraneda" >}}). Currently I am a Ph.D. student in Physics at the same department, under the guidance of [Dr. Roberto Navarro]({{< relref "/authors/rnavarro" >}}).

During my Master's studies I developed a pseudo-spectral numerical library to solve the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations, and used it to study the transverse instability of Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal modes in 2D-2V.
At present I am developing hybrid (PIC-fluid) simulations for the study of parametric instabilities in solar-wind-like plasmas.

I love nature, open knowledge and breaking the routine. I'm also a programming enthusiast; I use [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/) for almost everything, although I like it better on [evil mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil), and my simulations run each time happier to be written in the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language. I use [Arch](https://archlinux.org/), by the way.
