He finished his studies on Physical Sciences in early 2021 under the supervision of [Dr. Jaime Araneda]({{< relref "/authors/jaraneda" >}}) and [Dr. Roberto Navarro]({{< relref "/authors/rnavarro" >}}). His tesis focused on the transition between the linear and nonlinear stages of the Landau damping in a electrostatic colisionless plasma. Currently, he is a Master's student in physics, and researches on the transient growth phenomena in plasmas after a perturbation from equilibrium.
