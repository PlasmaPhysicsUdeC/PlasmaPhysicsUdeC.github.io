Daniel is a PhD student in Sciences with mention in Physics under the
advise of Dr. Jaime Araneda and Dr. Roberto Navarro. He was born in
Colombia, where he completed his undergraduate and master studies at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. He is actually researching about parametric instabilities of ion-cyclotron waves in solar wind-like plasmas. He also likes to play soccer and to take photographs of birds and wild life together with his son, Ángel.
