abstract: Wave-particle interactions are believed to be one of the
  most important kinetic processes regulating the heating and
  acceleration of solar wind plasma.  One possible explanation for the
  observed preferential heating of alpha (He+2) ions relies on a
  process similar to a second-order Fermi acceleration mechanism. In
  this model, heavy ions are able to resonate with multiple
  counter-propagating ion-cyclotron waves, while protons can encounter
  only single resonances, resulting in the subsequent preferential
  energization of minor ions. In this work, we address and test this
  idea by calculating the number of plasma particles that are
  resonating with ion-cyclotron waves propagating parallel and
  antiparallel to an ambient magnetic field $\vec{B}_0$ in a
  proton/alpha plasma with cold electrons. Resonances are calculated
  through the proper kinetic multispecies dispersion relation of
  Alfvén waves. We show that 100% of the alpha population can resonate
  with counter-propagating waves below a threshold $|\Delta U_{\alpha
  p}/v_A| < U_0 + a(\beta_p +\beta_0)^b$ in the differential streaming
  between protons and He+2 ions, where $U_0=-0.532$, $a=1.211$,
  $\beta_0=0.0275$, and $b=0.348$ for isotropic ions. This threshold
  seems to match with constraints of the observed $\Delta U_{\alpha
  p}$ in the solar wind for low values of the plasma beta
  ($\beta_p$). Finally, it is also shown that this process is limited
  by the growth of plasma kinetic instabilities, a constraint that
  could explain alpha-to-proton temperature ratio observations in the
  solar wind at 1 AU.
