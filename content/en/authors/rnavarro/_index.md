Roberto is Associate Professor in the Physics Department of the
Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences of the Universidad de
Concepci贸n. He joined the institution through the program of Insertion
of Advanced Human Capital in the Academy (PAI) of CONICyT.

He specializes in Space Plasma Physics, in particular, he researches
on the basic processes that govern the heating and energization of
plasmas in the Universe as well as their importance in different
turbulent regimes in space physics, astrophysical and laboratory
plasmas.
