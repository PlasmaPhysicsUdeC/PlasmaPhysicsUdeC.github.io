Master's student in physics. He obtained a bachelor's degree in
physical sciences in 2018. In 2019 he started the Master's program
under the supervision of Dr. Roberto Navarro with whom he is actually
studying systems with long-range interactions that exhibit
quasi-stationary states out of thermodynamic equilibrium.
