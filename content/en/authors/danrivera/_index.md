Master's student in physics. He obtained a bachelor's degree in physical sciences in 2018. In 2019 he started the Master's program under the supervision of Dr. Roberto Navarro with whom is actually investigating systems with long-range interactions that exhibit quasi-stationary states outside thermodynamic equilibrium.
